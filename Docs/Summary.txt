If a method return type is void,by default statuscode 204-no content is returned
When new item is created ,we should be returning status code -201-Item created
With 201 status code,we should also include the location i.e. URI of the newly created item.
When an item is not found,instead of returning Null abd status code-200-ok,return 404-not found along with meaningful message (like id=.. not found)
